# C# Coding Assignment: "Allergies"
#### for Epicodus completed by Shannon Lee and Saoud Rana

## Description
This project was completed for Epicodus as a part of the part-time full-stack developer program to demonstrate understanding of Test Driven Development using C#.

## Assignment
**from the [Epicodus curriculum](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net-part-time-c-and-react-track/test-driven-development-with-c/triangle-tracker-palindromes-allergies)**

_Here's something a bit trickier and please only attempt this if you have completed the previous projects and had them checked by an instructor. An allergy score is a single number that tells what someone is allergic to. The scores for each allergen are:_
```
allergen     score
eggs         1
peanuts      2
shellfish    4
strawberries 8
tomatoes     16
chocolate    32
pollen       64
cats         128
```
_So if someone is allergic to eggs and strawberries, they get a score of 9._

_Build a website that uses a method that is called on someone's score - i.e. the score is the object, and returns an array listing what they're allergic to. For example, running `allergies(3)` should print a list of the person's allergies (eggs and peanuts) to the screen._
